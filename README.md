# password_generator_refactor

The goal of this project will be to refactor code that wil lallow a user to generate a password thorugh the DOM. The user must be able to choose the number of characters the password will contain and the type of characters; choosing to use lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The user inputs must be validated and the password generated must be displayed either in a window alert or written to the page. This page should be web responsive on all devices. I am the sole editor of this project and will be the only one writing code. This project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
